<h2>Summary</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>My name is Alex Chacha. After highschool, I made the decision not to further my educations through a college nor 
        University. In doing so I was able to work various jobs, some at the same time, and able to learn various lessons.
        Most importantly I learned that the path to personal success doesn't have to come with a degree but rather it comes 
        through the determintation and drive that one puts on themselves. With that being said, To all potential future employers
        you will be getting a man who does is not only determined and has drive, but you will also be getting a team player, a 
        go-getter, and also a man who isnt afraid to fail.
